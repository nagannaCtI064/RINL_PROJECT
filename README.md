## **Overview**
This project aims to predict the skin temperature of blast furnaces using machine learning techniques, specifically employing Python, Flask, and the Random Forest algorithm. It was developed during an internship at RINL (Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited) in the IT & ERP Department.

## **Features**
- **Prediction Model**: Utilizes a Random Forest machine learning model to predict blast furnace skin temperature.
- **Data Processing**: Implements data preprocessing techniques and feature engineering to optimize model performance.
- **Integration**: Collaborated with metallurgical experts to incorporate domain knowledge into the model for improved accuracy and applicability.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual insights into model predictions and performance metrics.

## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Flask
- Random Forest algorithm (from scikit-learn)
- HTML/CSS (for frontend if applicable)
